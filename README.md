# Data Collections

This project is a CSV parser that takes a CSV string, processes it, and performs various operations on the data.

## Part 1: Refactoring Old Code

The code starts by taking a CSV string and splitting it into rows. Each row is then split into cells using a comma separator. The cells are then joined with a space and pushed into a two-dimensional array.

## Part 2: Expanding Functionality

The code then calculates the number of columns dynamically based on the first row of data. This allows the code to accept any number of columns.

## Part 3: Transforming Data

For each row of data in the result array, the code creates an object where the key of each value is the heading for that valueâ€™s column. The keys are converted to all lowercase letters for consistency. These objects are stored in an array, in the order that they were originally listed.

## Part 4: Sorting and Manipulating Data

The code then performs various operations on the data:

- Removes the last element from the sorted array.
- Inserts a new object at index 1.
- Adds a new object to the end of the array.
- Calculates the average age of the group.

## Part 5: Full Circle

Finally, the code transforms the final set of data back into CSV format.

## Running the Code

To run the code, simply open it in a JavaScript environment and execute it.
